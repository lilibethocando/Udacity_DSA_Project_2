# Explanation problem 2: File Recursion

I created the find_files function that takes in suffix and path as parameters
After checking if the path is not empty, a while loop is initiated for searching 
the specified suffix on each directory. Finally, the files list is returned. 

Time complexity is **O(n)** and space complexity is **O(n)**.
