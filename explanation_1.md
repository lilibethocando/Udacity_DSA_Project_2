# Explanation problem 1: Least Recently Used Cache

I created 2 classes a DoubleNode and LRUCache, then created different methods in the last one
for obtaining and removing of retrieving a given object so the last recently used node was to be populated.

Time complexity is O(1). Space complexity of the LRU Cache is O(n).
