# Explanation problem 3: Huffman Coding

I created a TreeNode class and multiple methods in it. 
First I calculated the frequency of each character and then created a create_huffman_tree function 
with the heapq Python function which works like a priority queue. 
Then followed the instructions for encoding and decoding a string.

Time complexity for this is **O(nlogn)** and space complexity is **O(logn)**.
