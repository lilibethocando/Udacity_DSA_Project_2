# Explanation problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
I created both functions using linked lists and then sets methods 
for Union function I used "Add" and for the Intersection one "&", then 
I added the result of those sets (sorted) to a list and appended all the nodes, then returned the list.

Time complexity for both functions is **O(n)** and space complexity for both functions is **O(n)**.
